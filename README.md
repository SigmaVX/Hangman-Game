<h1>Hangman Game</h1>

<p>Can you guess one of the top 100 highest grossing movies of all time (through 2017)? Simply select the letters and numbers on your keyboard to guess which random top title has been picked by WOPR. If you know what the WOPR is then you and Mathew Broderick are already ahead of the game. Turn your sound on if you are looking for a little extra movie clip encouragement...or discouragement. You will get 10 guesses to show off your intellectual superiority. Good luck!</p>

<p>Note: the sound clips and text is not related to the hidden title! The WOPR is evil like that.</p>

<h2>Key Elements</h2>

<p>-This game uses Bootstrap 4 and is mobile responsive.<p> 
<p>-The game is built using JavaScript to randomize sounds, word choices, and to manipulate the DOM.</p> 
<p>-Functions are used to streamline the code and to scale up the options (e.g. more random cheers and jeers).</p>
